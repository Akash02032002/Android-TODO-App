Akash Kumar. This is an android-based gaming project. There are two parts to this project. One is UI and the other is Back-End part. In it, I have used XML for the UI design and JAVA for the Back-End part smoothly for a better experience of the games. As It's an open source project. So, It's open for anyone to download the source code and use it.
